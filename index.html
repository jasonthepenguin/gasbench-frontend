          <h2>Model Leaderboard</h2>
          <p class="leaderboard-explanation">Each model was tested on multiple customer service refund scenarios. <strong>Note: All models tested are non-reasoning models.</strong> "API calls" shows the total number of API calls needed to complete all tasks. "Non-failing %" represents the percentage of function calls that executed successfully without errors.</p>
          <ol class="lb-list">

            <h3>Why fewer turns with higher reliability is a strong signal</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Fewer turns = better planning:</strong> Completing days in fewer API calls shows the model can reason upfront, choose the right actions, and avoid unnecessary back-and-forth.</li>
              <li><strong>Policy and constraints adherence:</strong> High non-failing rate means it checks refund policy, capacity, and cash before acting—reducing wasted attempts and retries.</li>
              <li><strong>Effective action ordering:</strong> Prioritizing the right calls (e.g., validate receipt before refund, check status before ordering) prevents avoidable failures.</li>
              <li><strong>No loops or churn:</strong> Low total actions with few (or zero) failed actions indicates it doesn't get stuck correcting itself or repeating mistakes.</li>
              <li><strong>Operational impact:</strong> This combo yields faster runs, lower cost, cleaner logs, and more consistent profits—exactly what your leaderboard measures.</li>

            <h3>Key Differences</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Sonnet completes the task in 4 API calls vs. 6 for GPT-4o</li>
              <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Sonnet checks inventory first, then verifies receipt; GPT-4o attempts refund immediately and fails</li>
              <li><strong>Error handling:</strong> Sonnet avoids errors entirely; GPT-4o has 2 failed attempts</li>
              <li><strong>Customer experience:</strong> Both complete the refund, but Sonnet's more efficient approach means faster resolution</li>
